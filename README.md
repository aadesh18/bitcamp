We have always been fascinated by the world of real estate and investing, but like many others, lacked the resources and capital to pursue it. Real estate, in particular, has always intrigued us as it is a stable asset that typically appreciates over time. However, the high cost of entry has always been a challenge.

Fortunately, we realized that by pooling our resources, a group of like-minded individuals could combine our collective capital to invest in real estate. This approach not only allows us to take advantage of real estate's stability and appreciation potential but also helps us to diversify our investment portfolios.

We are proud to announce that we have built a platform that enables individuals to invest in real estate together. Our platform provides users with the opportunity to pool their resources and invest in a range of properties that suit their investment preferences.

## Getting Started
For the mobile application, we have used Flutter. The files for flutter can be found in the lib folder. The files are structured by their functionality, which is either data, theme or UI. 

For the backend processing and analysis, we have used Python. The files for Python can be found in the backend folder.
